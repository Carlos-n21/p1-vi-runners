# VI Runners Bristol

Overview
Welcome to the website of VI Runners Bristol, a community group for visually impaired runners from Bristol, UK. 
This website serves as an informative platform for existing and prospective members to learn more about our activities, benefits of running, and how to join us.

The idea is for the site to be accessible for visually impaired users, the background color used was white (#FFFFFF) and the font color was black (#000000) for the main content.
For the tile and heading used blue (#0000FF). This provides a high contrast ratio of 21:1, provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF)
