Fonts Used: Roboto, Oswald, sans-serif.

The idea is for the site to be accessible for visually impaired users, the background color used was white (#FFFFFF) and the font color was black (#000000) for the main content.
For the tile and heading used blue (#0000FF). This provides a high contrast ratio of 21:1 for the main content. Provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF)
